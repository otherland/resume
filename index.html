                <p class="work-entry__subtitle">Leading the modernization of a connected care platform serving 200+ UK facilities and 10,000+ elderly residents</p>
            </div>
            <div class="work-entry__body">
                <div class="work-entry__narrative">
                    <p>When I arrived at Canary Care, the organization was sitting on a complex, sprawling codebase reflecting
                    nearly a decade of product evolution. The frontend was a hybrid of legacy PHP-rendered views layered
                    with progressively-enhanced JavaScript. The backend was a patchwork of PHP microservices, Python services
                    added organically, and infrastructure tightly coupled to Rackspace VMs with manual, error-prone deployments.
                    As a health and safety company caring for vulnerable elderly residents, operational reliability wasn't
                    optional &mdash; it was existential.</p>

                    <p>I took ownership of the frontend-first modernization, migrating the build system from Webpack 4 to Vite
                    (cutting hot module reload from 30+ seconds to near-instant), implementing Yarn Berry with Plug'n'Play
                    dependency resolution, and establishing a containerized deployment model. The React migration itself reached
                    Phase 9 completion &mdash; I documented and implemented 50+ endpoints across nine distinct phases, from
                    authentication and system status through complex data aggregation to user management and hub configuration.
                    The Python FastAPI backend I built for these endpoints delivered 3&ndash;72% performance improvements over
                    legacy PHP, with reference data endpoints showing 70%+ speedup.</p>

                    <p>The containerization initiative was the larger challenge. I conducted an audit revealing 18 distinct services
                    (not the assumed 26), mapped every dependency, and created a phased approach. I wrote Dockerfiles with
                    multi-stage builds optimized for production, a consolidated Azure DevOps pipeline building all backend
                    images in parallel with multi-stage approval gates, and Terraform configurations for ECS task definitions
                    with proper IAM role separation. By early 2026, 7 services were containerized, 2 were deployed to production
                    on ECS, and 4 more were ready pending approvals &mdash; a clear path from fragile VMs to reproducible,
                    auditable infrastructure.</p>

                    <p>I led the response to a critical security incident where passwords were being logged unencrypted in Grafana.
                    Within 30 minutes I traced the root cause to a specific PHP file, implemented a Grafana Alloy filter as
                    immediate mitigation, then coordinated across team boundaries for a comprehensive multi-layer fix: Grafana
                    filter, Apache filter, and PHP-level redaction. I also drove a systematic migration of hardcoded credentials
                    to AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, achieving 64% migration in the first month with database credentials
                    at 100%.</p>

                    <p>Across all this work, I created comprehensive observability infrastructure &mdash; Grafana dashboards tracking
                    service versions, deployment history, and rollback capability. I consolidated 677 Confluence pages into
                    searchable knowledge bases and maintained a tracking repository with 26 active operational scripts. This
                    isn't just code modernization; it's a multi-dimensional transformation spanning frontend, backend, infrastructure,
                    and organizational knowledge.</p>

                <p class="work-entry__subtitle">Built the entire technical stack for a B2B lead generation and sales automation platform from scratch</p>
            </div>
            <div class="work-entry__body">
                <div class="work-entry__narrative">
                    <p>Wexley Capital is a B2B automation and lead generation platform I designed and built end-to-end.
                    Registered as both a US LLC and UK Ltd, the business is currently in an advisory incubator program.
                    The technical stack I created processes millions of contacts across disparate data sources, implements
                    advanced browser automation, and combines AI-powered lead scoring with email verification at scale.</p>

                    <p>The centrepiece is a unified BigQuery dataset of 162M+ deduplicated contacts from 7 sources including
                    Pitchbook, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, and Apollo. I built the ETL pipelines, deduplication logic, and query
                    infrastructure to make this data actionable. Sitting on top of that, the <strong>Lead Scorer</strong> uses
                    a multi-model AI system with API key rotation across Gemini instances, scoring hundreds of thousands of
                    records using ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel throughput of 100&ndash;200 operations per minute.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>Apollo Scraper</strong> is the most technically complex piece &mdash; a three-tier extraction
                    system. The primary tier uses direct HTTP requests via curl_cffi, reconstructing exact API request patterns
                    including cryptographic transaction IDs and client hints, achieving 10&ndash;20x performance over browser
                    automation. The fallback tier uses GoLogin + Playwright with injected JavaScript for tab visibility spoofing
                    and DOM scraping. The orchestration tier coordinates parallel scrapes across multiple authenticated accounts
                    with per-account locking, LRU selection, and automatic session refresh.</p>

                    <p><strong>LinkZen</strong> is a full API product I built with PostgreSQL backend (6.8M exec records, 2.5M
                    companies), rate limiting, API key management, and audit logging. It combines domain MX checking, team page
                    crawling, LinkedIn public API scraping, and email verification via direct SMTP for Google/Microsoft plus
                    Truelist API for other providers. A CSV folder watcher daemon monitors for new files, verifies email addresses,
                    and streams results to the database with progress tracking.</p>

                    <p><strong>XEngine</strong> automates Twitter/X engagement with a sophisticated HTTP API client that bypasses
                    browser overhead entirely, reconstructing Twitter's exact request patterns. It runs as a Unix-style daemon
                    via launchd with SQLite persistence, token bucket rate limiting, and persona-driven content generation
                    using Claude for voice-matched tweets and contextual replies. The <strong>Sales Assistant</strong> provides
                    structured discovery and objection-handling as a client-side SPA with 130+ categorized objection handlers
                    and URL-routable content.</p>

                    <p>The full platform connects data sourcing, AI scoring, email verification, outreach automation, and sales
                    enablement into a cohesive pipeline. Each component was built to solve a real problem in the B2B sales
                    workflow, not as theoretical exercises.</p>

                    <p>I designed and built an email campaign platform managing 1,500+ sending accounts with a Django/Celery/Redis
                    backend. The system handles sender reputation tracking, bounce processing, and field-level encryption using
                    Fernet for credential storage. Deliverability across that many accounts requires understanding DNS
                    (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), IP warming, and domain reputation at an operational level.</p>

                    <p>For Microsoft 365, I automated tenant provisioning across 6+ tenants with 600+ managed identities. The
                    orchestration system coordinates AdsPower browser profiles for sandboxed sessions, Porkbun/DreamHost APIs
                    for automatic DNS TXT record verification, and PowerShell scripts for bulk user creation. A parallel
                    factory runner handles multiple tenants simultaneously, tracking progress through an Excel-based order system.</p>

                    <p>On the security research side, I used Shodan to discover vulnerable internet-facing systems including active
                    crypto mining botnets, and responsibly disclosed findings to affected organizations. BigQuery pipelines
                    I designed process 1B+ records with deduplication, industry classification, and filter management. The
                    infrastructure spans multi-cloud deployments across Render, Fly.io, and Contabo, with Docker containerization,
                    health checks, and automated rollback procedures.</p>

                    <p>I also built a distributed cryptographic computation framework that fragments sensitive algorithms across 4
                    geographically distributed VPS nodes using Shamir (3,4) threshold secret sharing. The system uses a WireGuard
                    mesh network with AES-256-GCM session keys, Ed25519 signature authentication, and nonce-based replay
                    protection. Compromising any 2 of 4 nodes (across Hetzner, DigitalOcean, Vultr, and Contabo) still leaves
                    the system secure &mdash; genuine information-theoretic security, not just operational security.</p>
